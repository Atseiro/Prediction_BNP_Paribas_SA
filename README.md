## Project Overview

The project processes financial data, including stock prices and trading volumes, to provide insights and predictions. It uses libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Bootstrap for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

The primary goal of this project is to predict time series data using the **SARIMAX** (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model. A deep analysis of the different components of the time series will be conducted, including trend, seasonality, and residuals. Hypothesis testing and correlation studies will also be performed to validate assumptions and identify relationships within the data.
